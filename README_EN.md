# PastelDash

Here is my most recent project. It's named Pastel Dash and its a relaxing side scroller. The esthetic that we were going for is simple and modern.
One of the particularities of the project is that the terrain and colors are generated randomly by the computer. It was coded using Unity.
We've learned a lot with this project, it has furthered our knowledge of Unity as a game engine but also allowed us to better understand generation (like terrains for instance) using programs and not manual generation.

This was a group project with two other students (so 3 couting me) all from Valrose University in Nice. I was mainly in charge of the project and took responsibility for the development.
As a group we've used GitHub as it's very efficient to work on the same project remotely. We've also used Discord for group calls when we couldn't see each other.

Before going any further [here](README.md) is a french version of the prensentation of this Project.

The above images were all taken in game. As you can see to achieve such a style we have heavily relied on simple geometric figures and light color tones that work well together.
These two factors we hope satisfy visually the gamer playing our game. We studied similar games in the market in terms of gameplay to better understand what direction 
we were moving to with this project. After analyzing multiple games we had two big inspirations: 99 Problems and Geometry Dash.

In total we have worked a little under 2 months on this project meeting both physically and virtually. 
It was a great experience, the next step is now to commercialize our futur projects.
